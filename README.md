# Stock Portfolio Optimization

![Project Banner](https://your-image-link.com/banner.jpg)

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing a stock portfolio using historical stock data fetched from `yfinance` and Monte Carlo simulations. The optimized portfolio is evaluated based on the Sharpe ratio to ensure the highest risk-adjusted return.

## Features

- Fetch historical stock data using `yfinance`
- Perform portfolio optimization using Monte Carlo simulation
- Evaluate portfolios based on the Sharpe ratio
- Generate and visualize optimized portfolios

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `yfinance`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**


2. **Install the Required Libraries**


## Usage

### Fetching Stock Data

- Use `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data for the desired tickers.
- Specify the stock tickers and the date range for the data.

### Portfolio Optimization

- Perform Monte Carlo simulation to optimize the stock portfolio.
- Randomly generate portfolio weights.
- Calculate portfolio returns and volatility.
- Compute the Sharpe ratio for each portfolio.
- Identify the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.

### Evaluation

- Evaluate the performance of the optimized portfolio based on the Sharpe ratio.
- Visualize the results using a scatter plot to show the relationship between volatility and return, highlighting the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.


## Results

- The final optimized portfolio is judged based on the highest Sharpe ratio, ensuring the best risk-adjusted return.
- The results are visualized to provide clear insights into the performance of different portfolios.
